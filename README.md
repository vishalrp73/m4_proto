# Turners M4 Prototype FRONT END

Front-end repository for M4 Turners Prototype.

You'll need a .env file with relevant details for:

REACT_APP_ACCESS_KEY_ID | REACT_APP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | REACT_APP_MODELARN

These are all for AWS and are only required for starting the Rekognition model, you can use the testing endpoint (in the backend repo) otherwise
